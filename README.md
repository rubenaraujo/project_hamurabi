    P(1 + r/n) ^ nt
    Future Value of a Series
    PMT * (((1 + r/n)^nt - 1) / (r/n)) * (1+r/n) 
    
    A = [Compound Interest for Principal] + [Future Value of a Series]
    
    A = the future value of the investment/loan, including interest
    P = the principal investment amount (the initial deposit or loan amount)
    PMT = the monthly payment
    r = the annual interest rate (decimal)
    n = the number of times that interest is compounded per year AND additional payment frequency
